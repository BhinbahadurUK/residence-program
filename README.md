# Stacks Resident Program Announcement 

Hello and thank you for your interest in the Stacks Foundation Resident Program!

Please note we are in the process of making some small adjustments to the Residents program and are not accepting new applications at this time. As part of these adjustments we will be migrating the application pipeline over to our newly launched [Grants Dashboard](https://grants.stacks.org/). The GitHub repo of resident applications will remain open, but for reference only. 

We anticipate re-opening the application process on the Grants Dashboard sometime in June 2022.

- If you would like to learn more about the Grants Dashboard please check out this [blog post](https://www.stacks.org/grants-dashboard).
- If you have questions about the Grants Dashboard in general please email [ambassadors@stacks.org](mailto:ambassadors@stacks.org).
- If you have questions regarding payments and/or contracts please email [payments@stacks.org](mailto:payments@stacks.org).

Thank you and we look forward to supporting your efforts to build a user-owned internet, powered by Stacks and secured by Bitcoin!
